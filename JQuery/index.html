        Laguna Miñiques is a lake in northern Chile. It lies at the foot of the volcano Cerro Miscanti, south of Laguna Miscanti, from which it receives inflow by seepage. The two lakes are separated by a lava flow. Like Miscanti and the nearby Laguna Lejía,
        Miñiques is a fault-bound lake and has brackish waters. A popular tourist destination, it is part of the Los Flamencos National Reserve, and is home to wildlife including the cladocerans Alona pulchella and Daphnia, the copepod Boeckella poopoensis,
        and unidentified species of Cyclopoida. This panoramic photograph of Laguna Miñiques was taken in February 2016.
